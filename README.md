## 🧩 Installation

### Option 1: Use from GitHub

Add this to your project's `composer.json`:

```json
"repositories": [
  {
    "type": "vcs",
    "url": "https://github.com/amdadulshakib/laravel-project-installer"
  }
]
```

Then run:

```bash
composer require amdadulshakib/installer
```

### Option 2: Use Locally (For development)

Add this to your `composer.json`:

```json
"repositories": [
  {
    "type": "path",
    "url": "packages/amdadulshakib/Installer"
  }
]
```

Then install:

```bash
composer require amdadulshakib/installer:@dev
```

## ⚙️ Publish Assets and Views

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=installer-views
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=installer-assets
```

---

## 🛡️ Middleware

This package auto-registers a middleware `install.lock` that prevents accessing the app before installation.

You can apply globally using:

```php
$this->app['router']->pushMiddlewareToGroup('web', \amdadulshakib\Installer\Middleware\IsNotInstalled::class);
```

Middleware Logic:

- If `/storage/installed.lock` does **not** exist, it redirects to `/install`  
- After successful installation, the lock file is created  
- Trying to access `/install` again after installation is **blocked**

---

## 🧪 SQL Import Instead of Migrations

The package does **not** use migrations. Instead, it imports `database.sql` from:

```
packages/amdadulshakib/Installer/database/database.sql
```

Place your pre-built SQL dump file here to set up the database during installation.

----------

## ✍️ Usage Steps

1. Visit `/install`  
2. Go through:
   - Welcome  
   - Requirements check  
   - Environment setup  
   - Database setup (will import `database.sql`)  
   - Admin user creation  
   - Finish  
3. After installation, a `storage/installed.lock` file will be created  
4. Any access to `/install` after installation will be **blocked**

---

## 🎨 Styling

To include CSS or JS:

1. Place files in `packages/amdadulshakib/Installer/public/`
2. Publish them using:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=installer-assets
```

3. Use in views:

```blade
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ asset('vendor/installer/css/installer.css') }}">
<script src="{{ asset('vendor/installer/js/installer.js') }}"></script>
```
